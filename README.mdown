Cooking Show-Style Live Coding
===

When live coding during a demo, I like to minimize the amount of typing I need to do. I don't want to put the audience through that!

Chefs on cooking shows (Julia Child, Ming, etc.) solve this problem by cooking while the camera isn't running, either before the show or during breaks in filming.

This repo contains snippets used for cooking-show-style live coding.
